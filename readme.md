# Crunchbase/Slack Integration

This is a tool that allows for querying the crunchbase API via custom "slash" commands in a slack channel

## Commands

 #`/cb-org <org name>` - Perform a search for a given company. Code will look for exact match first, and if nothing is found then fall back to CB's search endpoint
 
 * *Facebook* - Facebook is an online social networking service that enables its users to connect with friends and family as well as make new connections
 
 *
 
 * `/cb-per <persons name>` - Return CB info on a given person
